                When people ask me why I chose to become a therapist, my answer…
                "It chose me!" I graduated from Tennessee Technological
                University in 2013 with my Master’s in Mental Health Counseling
                and I have been practicing since. I am a Therapist that provides
                services to all ages, and diversified backgrounds. I have
                experience working with trauma and recovery for all ages. I
                worked several years to the Upper Cumberland Children’s Advocacy
                Center in Cookeville, Tennessee providing trauma-focused therapy
                to children and families that have been part of trauma related
                events. I have experience treating issues such as anxiety,
                depression, post-traumatic stress to name a few. I have
                completed specialized training in trauma and other modalities. I
                use different approaches that may include Eye Movement
                Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Cognitive Behavioral
                Therapy (CBT), and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
                (TF-CBT). When I am not working, I like to spend time with my
                family, and I enjoy all sports and being outdoors.

              <p class="content is-mont-p is-spaced">
                I began my journey in social services in 2004 when I began
                working with victims of domestic violence and became familiar
                with Upper Cumberland resources for those in need. In 2009, I
                began working with victims of child sexual abuse and their
                non-offending caretakers in order to connect them with needed
                resources and provided parenting education for those working
                with children with behavioral health issues. I graduated from
                Tennessee Technological University in December 2015 with my
                undergraduate focuses on Child Development and Family Relations.
                I chose to further my education with my Master’s in Social Work
                and graduated from University of Tennessee May of 2019. I am
                currently working towards my state licensure. I have also worked
                for the state as a Child Protective Services Investigator and
                was a contracted Family Services Worker as well. I currently
                work with Ten Broeck Tennessee providing therapy in both
                inpatient and outpatient setting. I use cognitive behavioral
                therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) along with
                other modalities. My passion is working with families to help
                stabilize and promote a healthy environment. I look forward to
                the opportunity to work with you and/or your family. Outside of
                working as a therapist, I enjoy spending time with my family, I
                love nature and love to be able to be in it! The beach is my
                happy place, gardening and landscaping is my Spring and Summer
                fun and I enjoy reading with a cozy blanket and coffee. I also
                enjoy using essential oils and learning more about them.
