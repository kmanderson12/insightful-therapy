              When people ask me why I chose to become a therapist, my answer…
              "It chose me!" I graduated from Tennessee Technological University
              in 2013 with my Master’s in Mental Health Counseling and I have
              been practicing since. I am a Therapist that provides services to
              all ages, and diversified backgrounds. I have experience working
              with trauma and recovery for all ages. I worked several years to
              the Upper Cumberland Children’s Advocacy Center in Cookeville,
              Tennessee providing trauma-focused therapy to children and
              families that have been part of trauma related events. I have
              experience treating issues such as anxiety, depression,
              post-traumatic stress to name a few. I have completed specialized
              training in trauma and other modalities. I use different
              approaches that may include Eye Movement Desensitization and
              Reprocessing (EMDR), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and
              Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). When I am
              not working, I like to spend time with my family, and I enjoy all
              sports and being outdoors.

              I began my journey in social services in 2004 when I began working
              with victims of domestic violence and became familiar with Upper
              Cumberland resources for those in need. In 2009, I began working
              with victims of child sexual abuse and their non-offending
              caretakers in order to connect them with needed resources and
              provided parenting education for those working with children with
              behavioral health issues. I graduated from Tennessee Technological
              University in December 2015 with my undergraduate focuses on Child
              Development and Family Relations. I chose to further my education
              with my Master’s in Social Work and graduated from University of
              Tennessee May of 2019. I am currently working towards my state
              licensure. I have also worked for the state as a Child Protective
              Services Investigator and was a contracted Family Services Worker
              as well. I currently work with Ten Broeck Tennessee providing
              therapy in both inpatient and outpatient setting. I use cognitive
              behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
              along with other modalities. My passion is working with families
              to help stabilize and promote a healthy environment. I look
              forward to the opportunity to work with you and/or your family.
              Outside of working as a therapist, I enjoy spending time with my
              family, I love nature and love to be able to be in it! The beach
              is my happy place, gardening and landscaping is my Spring and
              Summer fun and I enjoy reading with a cozy blanket and coffee. I
              also enjoy using essential oils and learning more about them.
